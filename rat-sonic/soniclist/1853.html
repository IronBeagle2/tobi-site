Time for a popquiz!

What if:   David Pistone was sucked into another reality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters met the M-team.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddeus Boyd was called on from the future.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyruggs         : Make a real processor, I'll make a real apology.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nintundo        : Well, I bought enough bloody games from you not

<br />
David looked over the keyboard again, &quot;DAMNIT! Where did that 'start' button
<br />
go to now?&quot; He frantically felt over the keyboard again--it was a new type,
<br />
designed especially for Windoze 95C. The human looked underneath the table,
<br />
fortunately he was able to locate the piece of plastic. &quot;Oh YES!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He stuck the button back on the keyboard, &quot;HAHAHA!&quot;, then after taking a
<br />
moments look--depressed it! But, the signal never reached the CPU, the PC's
<br />
internal DataBUS had in fact hung a long time ago--ever since he had loaded
<br />
the offensive data into memory.
<br />

<br />
&quot;DOUGH!&quot; Jamming the HARD-RESET button, he walked off to get some coffie
<br />
while the 80386-SX16 processor went about it's task of counting the 32Mb
<br />
memory he had on board--the memory he used as a Ramdrive to store all that
<br />
&quot;Sonic Mature Material&quot; he had collected up; after all with an MFM drive,
<br />
his ownly hope of viewing pictures that century was to load then into 300%
<br />
faster DRUM.
<br />

<br />
In the kitchen he took a moment to look outside, today was going to be a bad
<br />
day, already he could see the blue blurr..of a garbage sack, that the=
<br />
&nbsp;municipal
<br />
services had neglected to take away, lying on his front yard. Through the
<br />
frosted up window it looked a little less deadly than it really was, but
<br />
he knew the fatal truth--soon the tiny bacteria cells in Earth's atmosphere
<br />
would begin acting--turning the garbage into a chemical hazard.
<br />

<br />
&lt;ZOOOW!!&gt; The sound of a laser blast threw David's body limpely up against
<br />
a cupboard.. But before he saw stars, he reeled around, &quot;DAMNIT! WHY THE
<br />
BLUE BLAZING LASER TRAILING SUPER IONIZED FURR TOONIAC CHASING CARBON
<br />
ENTROPIED BADLY LISTING MASQUERADING PHREAKING VULPINE HELL CAN'T SBSET
<br />
PUT THE WINSTART VOLUME TO SOMETHING TOLERABLE???!!!???&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that he passed out.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Water molecules in the gaseous phase hovered over the house, the movement
<br />
of the two clouds causing electrons to be ripped off--creating a surge of
<br />
static electricity. The blue shard of lightning found it's way down to a
<br />
pine tree, turning it into a crispy.
<br />

<br />
David awoke, something furry was exerting a downward pressure on him! He
<br />
futily tried to struggle free--but whatever it was, it had him pinned down
<br />
with seemingly robotic strength. David wished he could get a better look
<br />
at what it was--after all, watching the carpet up close was less than
<br />
exciting.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Please, get off me!&quot; he begged, &quot;I can't breath, and.. uuh my allergies,
<br />
you're killing me!&quot; There was a type of heavy breathing from above him,
<br />
almost a type of laughing, then his captor shifted it's weight forward,
<br />
causing him to wheeze.
<br />

<br />
The next minute David Pistone new, something wet and not entirely pleasant,
<br />
was brushing over his ear. &quot;ARGGHHH!&quot; In a moment of frantic struggle he
<br />
threw it off. &quot;Stupid Bloody DOG!&quot; He glared at his Maltese poodle, it
<br />
glared back--until he blinked.
<br />

<br />
Losing the confrontation he retreated to his computer room, nothing much had
<br />
actually happened since he had left. Windoze 3.11111 was still drawing
<br />
the Poorgram Manger menu. &quot;DARN&quot; he remarked, and restarted his task of
<br />
getting coffie.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile inside the digital brain of his Cyruggs processor, little pieces
<br />
of silicon where beginning to do non-standard things. It seemed his A20
<br />
line had dropped from protected mode, and his Rom Basic was now installed.
<br />
Interrupt 21h, had been .. interrupted by the Creative Fabs, Sound Waster
<br />
on port 220h.. This had caused the SS and SI to be overshot.
<br />

<br />
David blew his stack,&quot;DAMN IT! I NEED A REAL COMPUTER! ONE THAT DOESN'T=
<br />
&nbsp;HANG!&quot;
<br />
He found himself going for the RESET button again. This time however, the
<br />
machine violently defended it's state of laziness--when he pushed the
<br />
switch, the entire thing fell back into the casing.
<br />

<br />
&quot;NOOO!&quot; he violently threw the steaming cup of coffie against the monitor,
<br />
the .28 smashed, and the boiling caffeine laden liquid spewed all over the
<br />
cathode ray gun. The mixture buzzed, letting out electromagnetic waves
<br />
on all frequencies.
<br />

<br />
The human collapsed onto the floor, tears rolling down his face. &quot;WHY? WHY?
<br />
JUST TAKE ME NOW!!! PLEAASE!&quot;
<br />

<br />
And Zeus decided to humour him, throwing a lightning bolt out of the sky
<br />
down onto the electrical lines. The energy went surging through the CRT,
<br />
the coffie became vapour, the caffeine became a Uranium isotope, David
<br />
reached his half-life. &lt;STEREOTYPE AND PUN&gt;
<br />

<br />
For the next few moments all he was aware of was static and chaos, and a
<br />
whole series of cheap special effects. Oh, yeah, and Dave also did notice
<br />
that he was being thrown through a dimensional vortex, some word came to
<br />
mind. &quot;Nagus&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;-
<br />

<br />
When he awoke he was standing in front of a crystal palace, he stared up at
<br />
it.. &quot;Wow Dave, that sure is one high palace.. so powerfull.. I wonder what
<br />
they call it? The 'Palace of Power?'&quot; He chuckled, then realising that he
<br />
was in an alternate reality.. he stopped.
<br />

<br />
Sitting down on the floor, he wondered to himself.
<br />
&quot;    #Where am I?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Is this palace symbolic of something?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Does the palace have Internet?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Why am I seeing the Merio Brothers?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Merio and Loo_ugly, stared at the strange human for a while, there was
<br />
something about him that posed a threat. Was it his face, No.. was it his
<br />
muscles.. NO WAY! It was the little Blue and White logo he wore on his
<br />
shirt, with the letters S*GA.
<br />

<br />
They hated S#GA, they much preffered Nintundo. Merio was the first to act,
<br />
&quot;Hey, SAGA boy, we're gonna jump on your head!&quot;
<br />
Dave froze, &quot;Uhhuhuh, huu he he.. um well..&quot;
<br />
Loo_ugly began too, &quot;Yeah.. We're gonna make you mushy like lasagna!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Umm err well.. he he.. &quot;
<br />
The two plumbers waved torque wrenches menacingly at him, while he=
<br />
&nbsp;frantically
<br />
backed up until bumping into something behind him.
<br />

<br />
Captain-M, drew his gun, &quot;Hey plumber-brothers, Get outta here!&quot;
<br />
They did.
<br />
Dave faced his savior, &quot;Thanks, you saved my life!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Kalvin laughed, &quot;Of course, I didn't want anybody breaking you, after all,
<br />
I want that honour !&quot;
<br />
Again he made whimpering sounds.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Inside the palace, Mr Pistone hung harmlessly upside down, SiMan BelGoon,
<br />
Kid StickyGUS, VEGAMan, and Princess WhoknowsWhathernameis, made sarcastic
<br />
comments.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey Kalvin, what if we put him through the time vortex?&quot; Vegaman sneered.
<br />
&quot;Naaah, uploading him via 2400 would be cool, but too expensive!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, what if we put him through the memory waster..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Naaaah, the ASAP might bust us, as our copy of DEFR_G is pirated..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Hmm.. What if we swap his brain with that of a hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's Mega cool VEGA-man, but, we don't have any hedgehogs..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Darn, well, why don't you just shoot him?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Hmm.. that's a cool idea..&quot;
<br />

<br />
He lifted his gun and aimed it at Dave's head, his eyes blinking with
<br />
determination. &quot;NO!&quot; The princess cried!
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
&quot;For God's Sake, not in the palace! Do you know how messy that will be?&quot;
<br />
Vegaman smiled, &quot;I'll clean it up princess!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Just then David got up some courage, &quot;Hey, I got such a cool plan! Why don't
<br />
you give me jet skates, and throw me into the void?&quot;
<br />
The princess patted Kalvin on the shoulder, &quot;Please Kalv, he would make
<br />
such a great crystal statue for the port'al room...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Captain-M stopped, &quot;Which room? The one with the port'al to Mobius?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes, the one on level three, room five, hall two!&quot;
<br />
&quot;You mean the one on l3,r5,h2, with Mobius on port'al three and landing
<br />
zone right in the middle of Knothole?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No the one on l3,r5,h2, with Mobius on three, landing zone-Knothole and
<br />
matter translation from Human to Vulpine ..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh *that* one, hey, you're right, he would look cool there! But, he'd look
<br />
better the right way up!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Dave shrugged his shoulders, a miraculous feat while hanging inverted.
<br />
&quot;Uuuh, could I have one last request?&quot;
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; They screamed in union.
<br />
&quot;But, I just wanted to see where I was going to be staying for the rest
<br />
of eternity... you know.. so I can stand right before I turn to crystal..&quot;
<br />

<br />
SiMan BelGoon butted in, &quot;he's right princess! Crystal Statues are the
<br />
absolute fad, but only if they stand the right way.&quot;
<br />
She looked at the pathetic human, &quot;hmm... you're right.. I mean, it's
<br />
not like he's going to jump into a port'al and escape is it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
-   -     -       -          -         -        -      -       -       -  -=

<br />

<br />
David stood in a peculiar way, SiMan complained. &quot;No No No, You're doing it
<br />
all wrong.. Stand like you're a Knight.. No no.. not an Earth Knight, a
<br />
starwarrior Knight...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Uuhm, excuse me.. But is that port'al in jumping distance of me to Mobius?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No Ways! You couldn't possibly jump that far, you'd have to run and jump
<br />
into that port'al..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh..&quot; The human built up some more courage, &quot;Hey look there! It's Mutha
<br />
Drain!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Where?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&lt;RUN! JUMP! SHLLURRP!&gt;
<br />

<br />
SiMan BelGoon stared at the Port'al, &quot;You mindless dit'zes, you let him get
<br />
away!&quot;
<br />
The princess yelled back, &quot;Go get him.. SiMan!&quot;
<br />
&quot;No way! I look absoloutely dreadful with furr..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Just go, maybe in a thousand years we'll work out how to turn vulpines
<br />
back into humans...&quot;
<br />
&quot;No ways princess.. Besides-- there are .. not nice .. things there!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Captain-M.. you go!&quot;
<br />
&quot;No ways, I'm no good at fighting computers, that'll mean I'll lose.
<br />
And I get upset when I lose... it's not game-master like..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Kid StickGUS?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Okay Princess... NOT!&quot;
<br />
&quot;VEGA man?&quot;
<br />
&quot;I don't think so your, highness!&quot;
<br />
&quot;OH geesh, that's the problem with you men, you're all cowardly!&quot;
<br />

<br />
They all stared at her, &quot;YOU GO THEN!&quot;
<br />
&quot;No ways, I might break a finger nail!&quot;

Notice from Simon: Some nice people from S#ga visited me (with=
<br />
&nbsp;Pump-actions),
<br />
and persuaded me not to rip off Sonic and all his wonderful friends,
<br />
that is why their real names will be used here. Apparently, the story from
<br />
here on will be straight forward.

<br />
David stood up, he felt kind of odd, warmish, furry.. he almost wanted to
<br />
hug himself.. uhhmm... maybe he could get someone to do it for him...later.
<br />

<br />
He took an observation of the proximity, lots of trees, and lots of trees,
<br />
he also noted that there were lots of trees around. &quot;Aha&quot; he told himself,
<br />
this was Knothole.. how extremely fascinillating.. there sure were a lot
<br />
of trees around.
<br />

<br />
The newly transformed fox walked a bit further, it seemed that he hadn't
<br />
popped up in the centre of Knothole--this posed a serious problem, as
<br />
there was no chance in whohaay that he'd simply find the place with the help
<br />
of some nice citizens directions.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay, David Pistone, you are a cool confident collected individual, how
<br />
would you find Knothole..&quot; He dropped to his knees to think.
<br />
&quot;What you need to do is find Sonic, then everything will be cool..
<br />
But.. how do *I* find him?&quot;
<br />

<br />
A dragon flew by overhead, almost not catching his attention. He dived up;
<br />
keeping his eyes on it; he ran as fast as he possibly could. &quot;DULCY!&quot;
<br />
She didn't notice, he ran faster. &quot;DULCY!&quot; Still no response, he pushed
<br />
himself to the maximum limit. &quot;DULCY!! HEYYYY HEREE!&quot;
<br />
Not looking at the floor he fell into a pool of water, the dragon flew
<br />
on without noticing him.
<br />

<br />
David choked bitterly as he climbed out of the crystal fluid, his only
<br />
hope now was that Knothole was near. He spun around to look at the pool
<br />
again--he could almost see Rotor, Sonic and Tails getting a power ring from
<br />
it.
<br />

<br />
Of course! This pool had to be the power ring pool! And if it was.. Knothole
<br />
was not very far off. But he knew one thing--he himself had once even said
<br />
it.. Knothole was so well hidden, you could get lost
<br />
just meters from the path.  Right now he had two choices--wait until Sonic
<br />
came to collect a power ring, or try his luck scouting for the village.
<br />

<br />
He decided on the former, sitting down on a fallen log, his mind began to
<br />
wonder... When he did eventually find the freedom fighters--what then?
<br />
What could he do for them? Why would they want an outsider like him?
<br />
What could he tell them? What if they didn't accept him?
<br />

<br />
There was a crackling from somewhere in the forest near him--someone or
<br />
something was coming. Instinctively he did a motion--that had he been
<br />
human, would have straightened his jacket.
<br />

<br />
The voices got louder, he could now make out Tails talking.
<br />
Soon they stopped in front of him, Sonic being the first to talk.
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;
<br />
But only stunned whimpers could come from David, hot flushes went through
<br />
his body; he tried to loosen his collar--but found out he didn't have one.
<br />
He tried to take a deep breath, but instead all he could summon was a short
<br />
ventilation. &quot;Uhhmm.. uuh.. Hi?&quot;
<br />
The hedgehog stepping closer was badly percepted by the new-fox, as bad
<br />
body circulation resulted in image warbling.
<br />

<br />
He fainted.
<br />

<br />
**TICK TOCK TICK TOCK**
<br />

<br />
A middled aged raccoon spoke to Sonic, &quot;He's fainted!&quot;
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
&quot;I guess you surprised him, either that or he's another of your crazy=
<br />
&nbsp;fans..&quot;
<br />
Tails blinked.
<br />

<br />
David began groaning into awakeness; Sonic started, &quot;You all right?&quot;
<br />
Still lying on the floor and his voice limited came a soft reply, &quot;..Yes..&quot;
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Um uhhrr.. I felt dizzy..&quot; The fox blushed.
<br />
Bookshire began, &quot;Who are you?&quot;
<br />
David, now more online; turned his head to face the raccoon; looked at him
<br />
oddly--his eyes over-expanded; Sonic helped him up.
<br />
David on his feet immediately started to Bookshire, &quot;Is your name=
<br />
&nbsp;Bookshire..
<br />
Bookshire Draftwood?&quot;
<br />
&quot;You know me?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh yes..&quot; Then turning to Tails, &quot;and you are Miles.. Miles Prower.. but
<br />
you prefer to be called.. &quot;
<br />
&quot;Tails&quot; the cub unioned.
<br />
Finally stopping his eyes on Sonic, &quot;And you are Sonic.. Sonic the=
<br />
&nbsp;Hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&quot;That's me.. now who are you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; he began automatically, &quot;I'm David Pistone... but most of my friends
<br />
call me Book..&quot; He remembered the raccoon.
<br />
&quot;Book?&quot; asked the hedgehog curiously.
<br />
&quot;Ahuum,.. BookKeeper.. but.. umm... you can call me.. David... yeah..=
<br />
&nbsp;David.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don't know, I kinda like BookKeeper.&quot; Smirked the hedgehog.
<br />

<br />
They all grabbed him before he could fall again. &quot;Uuh, thanks.. Sometimes
<br />
happens..must be the humidity and all..&quot;
<br />
Bookshire looked oddly at him, &quot;How did you get here?&quot;
<br />
This was the part he'd dreaded, he just froze pathetically. Trying to think
<br />
of what to say.
<br />
If I tell them some lie, it might catch up to me. But will they really=
<br />
&nbsp;believe
<br />
that I'm from Earth? What if I tell them I'm an escaped spy, with=
<br />
&nbsp;information
<br />
on Robotniks plans? That could work, I'd be important then..
<br />

<br />
Bookshire's fingers waved by his eyes, &quot;You Okay?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Uh yes.. Um.. Oh how I got here.. Well.. umm..&quot;
<br />
Sonic butt in, &quot;You lost?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well.. kinda.. but I'll find my way just now..&quot;
<br />
The raccoon stopped him, &quot;I don't think you will!&quot;
<br />
He almost choked, were they on to him? &quot;uuhuhuh, why not?&quot;
<br />
&quot;There's no way, if you keeping fading out like that.&quot;
<br />

<br />
His sigh of relief was noted, again Bookshire inquired. &quot;Are you all right?&quot;
<br />
David lost his nerve, &quot;Help me! I don't come from this planet!&quot;
<br />
The three freedom fighters looked at one another oddly, &quot;What!?!&quot;
<br />
His voice steadily increasing in speed, &quot;I come from the planet Earth, where
<br />
I'm a human, I came here through a port'al.. and it changed me to this!
<br />
I know all you because..&quot; A cold sweat ran over him, &quot;I can't tell you how..
<br />
but I just do.. I also know a lot of information about Robotnik..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Again, reality began darkening, Sonic caught him out of his descent, however
<br />
this time a bit too late--the fox was out cold. Again.
<br />

<br />
David awoke with a prickling agony in his left arm, he quickly tried to sit=
<br />

<br />
up, but something metallic stopped him; It was Bunnie's arm, and Bookshire
<br />
had just injected him with something.
<br />
&quot;Arr.. What in the blue-blazing null carrier DTR setting, pulse-width
<br />
modulating phreaking, digital realm's hell is that!?!&quot;
<br />
Bookshire however stayed collected, &quot;David, how do you feel?&quot;
<br />
&quot;uuh.. Okay I guess..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Now, why do you think you passed out?&quot;
<br />
&quot;uuuhmm... well.. you see.. umm.. just a bit too much excitement I guess..&quot;
<br />
&quot;I see.. now David.. What you told us before you.. fainted .. Is that true?&quot;
<br />
The fox paused; the raccoon who understood this--motioned Bunnie to leave
<br />
them; then used a soft comforting voice.
<br />

<br />
&quot;David.. It's allright you can tell me..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Okay.. well, I might was well tell you my life story. It began when I=
<br />
&nbsp;was..&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Really Boring Tick Tocks**
<br />

<br />
Somewhere else in the forest there was a type of corny-shlurping noise,
<br />
sounding like something out of a cheap monday afternoon cartoon with moral's
<br />
at the end. The cause of this was a human coming through the port'al,
<br />
instantly with a flash his body became a vulpine. A few seconds later,=
<br />
&nbsp;another
<br />
body came through... this time a female..the vulpine converter seemed to=
<br />
&nbsp;have
<br />
no difficulty coping with her either. (Unlike some things that error back to
<br />
DOS just because you save to an impossible file name.. &lt;DEW 5.1&gt;)
<br />
A few seconds later another body, then another, and then finally a robot.
<br />

<br />
They all stood around their leader, now a vulpea-vulpea (Red-fox), he lifted
<br />
a squarish box up--from it came beams of *really* bright light. The light
<br />
blinded all the boiwdies and beez for about two kilometers around, before
<br />
it finally died.
<br />

<br />
And when it did, it revealed, the M-Team--back in their original glory.
<br />
Kalvin was the first to speak, putting in a line that would excuse how they
<br />
got technology so quickly. &quot;Wow! This is great, I'm so glad that=
<br />
&nbsp;super-genius
<br />
came over.. hey princess?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sure thing Kalvin, we were so lucky that he had the plans for one of these
<br />
reverse-o-matic-vulpea-human-human-vulpea-molecular-restructurers around!&quot;
<br />
Vegaman butt in, in his normal croaking voice, &quot;We were so lucky that the
<br />
duplomatic was compatible with his computer.. your highness.&quot;
<br />
The princess smiled, &quot;Sure thing Vegaman, hey.. Kalvin, let's go.. It's
<br />
going to be night soon, and I really want a new pillow!&quot;
<br />

<br />
** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Back on Earth drops of coffie lost their state of high energy, the little
<br />
electrons dropping back to their standard orbit. It was then that something
<br />
amazing happened.. the data bus of the machine had a current induced into
<br />
it by an electromagnetic fluctuation brought on by cooling caffeine. This
<br />
surge caused the CPU to stop waiting on port 388h (Adlib); Windoze for
<br />
LurkGroups (almost) blazed back into life.
<br />

<br />
The screen began acting strange too, a layer of sugar had formed over the
<br />
hole in the glass, and all the air molecules had been teleported off to
<br />
Nintundo land. The result of this was that the screen began to regain it's
<br />
functionality.. the sugar acting as glass.. the caffeine acting as phosphor.
<br />
(believe me.. caffeine *Will* do that.. I mean MASA don't let astronauts
<br />
take coffie with them.. there has to be a reason!)
<br />

<br />
The 3.11 Logo came onto the screen, though it was not the standard one,=
<br />
&nbsp;David
<br />
had long ago changed that when he found out he could save with WINGUF to=
<br />
&nbsp;RLE.
<br />
The result of this.. a piccy of Sonic displayed on the screen, though it
<br />
was only in sixteen colour, but that didn't matter, as his display crOAK
<br />
display card only ran in 640X480X16 anyway.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
David stood firmly up as Princess Sally paced in an orbital around him,
<br />
Sonic, Bookshire and Rotor stood on the side--patiently waiting for some
<br />
outcome.
<br />
Sally continued, &quot;Well, David do you have any special abilities?&quot;
<br />
The fox's courage had increased now, &quot;Yes.. I know a lot about the future,
<br />
and umm.. well oh yeah.. when I drink coffie I can go on.. working on the
<br />
computer all NIGHT!&quot;
<br />
&quot;So you're good with computers?&quot;
<br />
He thought of his puny 386, &quot;Yes, considering that I can get Sting Commander
<br />
three to run on my system.. I would say so..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally's mind boggled, perhaps what they had was someone who could learn the
<br />
tricks from Bookshire, then execute them mid-mission. It was very tempting,
<br />
the possibility of being able to hack systems without either sneaking
<br />
the raccoon in, or risking the danger of being tracked when hacking by
<br />
remote; but she needed proof.
<br />
&quot;Can you show us how fast you type?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Uuh. sure..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Inside Rotor's hut he typed frantically at the keyboard, looking intensily
<br />
at it, Sonic, Sally and Bookshire made noises in awe, until finally he
<br />
stopped--out of breath.
<br />
The only problem David had, was while he could type fast, what he had typed
<br />
had merely been a load of crep, the new orientation of his fingers had been
<br />
a prime factor of this new language he'd invented.
<br />
&quot;Oooow.. I miss my pinkie.&quot; he complained.
<br />

<br />
The hedgehog stared at him oddly, &quot;What's a pinkie?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well&quot; he began informatively, &quot;it's like another finger..&quot;
<br />
Sonic lifted his gloved hand to his face oddly,
<br />
&quot;Another finger? That would be so.. so.. eeeeyyooww gross!..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Rotor patted the fox on the shoulder,
<br />
&quot;well, maybe after we give you some coffie?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, you shouldn't count on caffeine to make stuff grow, or enlarge.&quot;
<br />
&quot;No, I mean.. your typing..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, almost forgot.. Okay.. let's do that then..&quot;
<br />

<br />
The walrus collected a tin from the back, it was unusually light, and he=
<br />
&nbsp;soon
<br />
found out why. It was empty. He looked around for some more, but found that
<br />
he was all out of instant coffie. &quot;Oh well&quot; he sighed, &quot;Guess I'll just
<br />
have to give him *percolated* coffie..&quot;
<br />
He took some choice selected coffie beans, stuffed them in the grounder,
<br />
squeezed them till near fusion, then started up the machine. (It was petrol
<br />
operated.. and had a lawnmower engine, maximum power for extracting the
<br />
maximum caffeine content.)
<br />

<br />
&quot;Here you go&quot; he smiled, passing the fox the steaming mug;David quaffed it.
<br />
In a moment the chemical took effect on his body--there was a deep rumbling
<br />
that shook the ground; a slight spasmatic attack that propelled the mug
<br />
into the wall.. and then finally.. David let out a soft burp.
<br />

<br />
The freedom fighters sighed in relief;the fox sat down, typing slightly=
<br />
&nbsp;slow,
<br />
but his spelling and grammatic ablities incredibly boosted.
<br />
Sonic whined, &quot;NOOOO!&quot;
<br />
Sally stopped him, then continued on to the former human, &quot;Uhhm David,
<br />
maybe there's something else you can do?&quot;
<br />
Again the impatient hedgehog butt in, &quot;hey.. what about him for lookout...
<br />
after all.. it's not like he's ever going to sleep again.. not this decade!&quot;
<br />
David rotated his head, &quot;hey, that's a cool idea... when do I start?&quot;
<br />
Sally looked at the hedgehog queerly, waiting for some comment.
<br />
Sonic offered it, &quot;what about now.. let's go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that David slowly climbed out of his chair; walked even slower to the
<br />
door; watched Sonic zip out, and then.. zipped out next to him, pulling a
<br />
mean speed of 660M/s. His HIKE_AIRS just weren't prepared for these vectors,
<br />
they burst into flames sending him jumping around at mach-2 in agony.
<br />
It was then that Sally saw for the first time in her
<br />
life the extreme potence of high octane carbonized beans.
<br />

<br />
Sonic stopped him, &quot;Whoa.. Dave! That's amazing.. I wonder how long it will
<br />
last for?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Caffeine highs can last between three to eight hours!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Wow! That's amazing!&quot; Then facing back to Sally--who had come running to
<br />
them when they stopped, he began, &quot;hey Sal.. whatdya think? The guy's=
<br />
&nbsp;great!&quot;
<br />

<br />
** ** ** **  &lt;Wow! these ** patterns would be compressed with LZW!&gt;
<br />

<br />
Robotnik slammed buttons on the panels violentely, &quot;SNIVELY TELL ME.. WHY IS
<br />
IT THAT THE HEDGEHOG ALWAYS *WINS*?&quot;
<br />
The subservient stepped forward,
<br />
&quot;w..w.ww well sir.. I think it might have something to do with the=
<br />
&nbsp;terminals.&quot;
<br />
&quot;The terminals?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sir, while you designed them brilliantly two years ago.. technology does
<br />
change.. you see sir 2400 modems.. just aren't fast enough anymore.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Strange.. 2400 Gigabits a second seems more than sufficient to me.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well um sir.. you see.. it seems a group of freedom fighters are using
<br />
a new type of their own.. and.. it's &lt;GULP&gt; uuhmm bette.. has a higher
<br />
transfer rate..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes.. tell me more.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well sir.. they seem to have error correction too, it's called V34ditz, and
<br />
um, well sir.. they also have compression.. it's called MNOP5.. and sir..
<br />
their baud rate.. is well &lt;FRANTIC LAUGHS&gt; 9600.&quot;
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!? I don't want to be the only one in the neighbourhood who has to
<br />
wait while I download! I hope for your sake you've done something!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The human stepped forward proudly, &quot;Yes sir.. my system runs at 14.4Gbs..
<br />
I call it the US robotnik!&quot;  [NANANA CORNY!]
<br />
&quot;Brilliant Snively! I'm glad I thought of it, but the question is.. will it
<br />
be able to connect to existing terminals?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Of course, the US robotnik is fully downward compatible!&quot; [WISH THEY WERE]
<br />
&quot;But Snively, will it be easy to install and configure?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Of course, it's the half card internal solution! And thanks to the Ess
<br />
registers.. it's easy to configure!&quot;   [IF U LIKE SCANNING BOOKS AT 2:00AM]
<br />
&quot;But what if I don't have a technical guide handy when I need to setup one?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh sir! That's what the Sportstar is for, it automatically configures=
<br />
&nbsp;itself,
<br />
and can save setting to an onboard EPROM!&quot; [Prob:Settings always booga up]
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ha ha Snively, sometimes my genius astounds me! Now.. call dispatch and
<br />
send me up a prisoner.. I feel good!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Uhuhuh&quot; frantically laughed the human, &quot;sir.. we haven't had prisoners in
<br />
weeks..&quot;
<br />
&quot;What!?! Call Packbell, he'll get us some.&quot; then in a softer type of
<br />
whimpering, &quot;Packbell always does..&quot;
<br />

<br />
The android was caught unaware when the screen flicked to him, at the time
<br />
he was monitoring inter-dimensional waves. He reeled around angrily,
<br />
&quot;AAAR, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU.. oh, Hello..&quot;
<br />
Robotnik grinned, &quot;Packbell my boy, we seem to have run out of..=
<br />
&nbsp;disposables.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, send Snively to get some, there's a village marked on my notepad.&quot;
<br />
&quot;What?!? You haven't got them yet?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No.. I've been too busy studying jump traces.. it seems that four humanoids
<br />
and one robot have entered our world...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Humans! Packbell--get them! I haven't tortured humans since...&quot; he stared=
<br />
&nbsp;at
<br />
Snively who began backing off &quot;... since.. yesterday!&quot;
<br />
The android acknowledged.
<br />
From inside the control centre, the overlords nephew's head hitting the wall
<br />
like a ping-pong ball caused the entire structure to resonate.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
&quot;How much further SiMan?&quot; whined the Princess.
<br />
&quot;Oh, not much your highness, SiMan Belgoon never gets lost!&quot;
<br />
&quot;That's notacus!&quot; complained StickyGUS, &quot;are you forgetting about the
<br />
timicus in Clutsovania?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh that?&quot; he laughed, &quot;I was just a little bit confused..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Simanius.. we had to begicus directions...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&lt;CRACK!&gt;
<br />

<br />
The princess mottioned them to keep quite, &quot;Quite guys, somebodies coming!&quot;
<br />
&quot;SiMan Belgoon is a master of invisibility..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sure, now just keep quite!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I can blend right into the background..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Great just *keep* quite!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The group members each hid behind a tree.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Tails walked unknowingly on, Sally following some distance behind him, using
<br />
the excuse she always did to keep an eye out on him--that she needed a walk.
<br />
As the cub turned past one of the trees, there was a muffled whimpering=
<br />
&nbsp;sound,
<br />
and he dissapeared. Sally ran towards the spot, and in an instant was
<br />
facing SiMan Belgoon--his whip wrapped around her waist.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Aaah, how nice of you to join us..&quot; he boasted.
<br />
&quot;Who are you?!?&quot;
<br />
&quot;SiMan Belgoon..&quot; he bowed, &quot;..at your service!&quot;
<br />
Kalvin felt a bit left out so he also added an advert, &quot;..of the M-team!&quot;
<br />

<br />
SiMan, yanked his whip, causing Sally to unwind in the lamo style like in
<br />
cheap cartoons. She landed on the ground, looking up at Captain-M; Who was
<br />
holding Tails.
<br />

<br />
He dropped the fox cub next to her, and then the human princess took over.
<br />
She walked to Kalvin, who had his gun trained on the furries, and pointed
<br />
at Tails. &quot;Kalvin, he'll do just perfect! Look at that warm cuddly fur!&quot;
<br />
SiMan took a large skinning-knife out of his (seemingly) bottomless=
<br />
&nbsp;backpack.
<br />

<br />
Sally cuddled Tails, warding them off, &quot;Leave him alone! He's only a cub!&quot;
<br />
&quot;What?!?&quot; asked the other princess.
<br />
SiMan wasted no time in pulling out a dictionary and stealing the moment,
<br />
&quot;A cub--young member of a series of species groups, including bears, wolves
<br />
foxes, lions.. and also a shortened word used to describe an aircraft..&quot;
<br />
She patted him on the stomach, &quot;I know that, but what I want to know..&quot;
<br />
turning to Tails, &quot;are there any adults of your kind?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The two freedom fighters were shocked, so SiMan had to put an answer in
<br />
instead, &quot;..of course there are.. they obviously come from a primitive
<br />
village.&quot;
<br />
Kalvin finished by picking up the fox and pointing his gun at him, &quot;and you,
<br />
are going to take us there? Right?&quot;
<br />
Sally shuddered in silent fear.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
When they came into the village, chaos began to assert itself. The human
<br />
princess beginning the pillow selection process.
<br />
She looked at Antoine, nope not cuddly enough.
<br />
She looked at Jason, nope his skin had too many injuries on it.
<br />
As she headed towards David, Sonic abruptly butt in.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, just a Sonic sec, what's going on here?&quot;
<br />
Captain-M looked at him, and smiled.
<br />
&quot;Hey princess, do you mind if we bring him back with us?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Okay Kalvin, but you know the rule with pets..&quot;
<br />
It was then that SiMan remembered the SAGA fan who had been turned into a=
<br />
&nbsp;fox,
<br />
he whispered something into Kalvin's ear.
<br />

<br />
Kalvin then picked up Sally like a wet tea-towel, holding his blaster to her
<br />
head, &quot;Okay, there's someone here who joined you a while ago.. who?&quot;
<br />
Sally stared into David's eyes, &quot;I won't tell you!&quot;
<br />
She was a matyr or whatever they were called, Dave thought to himself, a few
<br />
moments later he found out she wasn't the only one--as he admitted that he
<br />
was the one.
<br />

<br />
With that, the M-Team selected their souvenirs, the princess took well, the
<br />
princess. The game-master took the faster-game-master. Vega man, took the
<br />
Mega-walrus. Kid StickyGUS, though that Tails would do nicely for archery.=
<br />

<br />
SiMan Belgoon really wanted to take the CyberBunny, but ended up taking
<br />
David for the human princess instead.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Smiled Kalvin, as the ropes were looped around their captives,=
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;let's
<br />
get back to the telezone!&quot;
<br />
And that they did, trampling through the bushes.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Simon Howes typed deperately at home on his computer, it seemed for some
<br />
reason that his mind was losing it's normal ability to generate fractal
<br />
stories. He loaded another personality--ten minutes later he began to peel
<br />
himself of the ceiling with a spatula.
<br />

<br />
He then went onto his favourite BBS, hoping to kill some time, the result,=
<br />
&nbsp;he
<br />
got Chromatiks II diskmag. Yay, now he had the ability to play. BTM.S3M,
<br />
&quot;behind that mask&quot;.. well.. now Simon was depressed even more.
<br />

<br />
He dialed the BBS, and it wasn't engaged. &quot;YES!&quot; he smiled, as he shaked a
<br />
clenched fist, but uncle Murphy laughed, for the BBS just kept on ringing.
<br />
Perhaps Rebecca was scared her little computer would get hurt by the=
<br />
&nbsp;lightning
<br />
from the storm that was now sweeping over the city.
<br />

<br />
Simon looked at the clock above his monitor 11:59, the room seemed to have
<br />
a frightening ambience--the storm had a hole in it.. just for him--just
<br />
large enough to brighten his house so that the screen could get a horrid
<br />
reflection on.
<br />

<br />
The song, played a flute, a sadish flute.. Well.. well.. that is the thread
<br />
of destiny. And Simon continued to define the alternate realm.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Walking through the misty forest, Kalvin was one of the first to notice the
<br />
movement ahead. In the diffused light, something pranced about.
<br />
A few seconds later it had vanished, Sonic's comments didn't.
<br />
&quot;Swat-bot! Get outta here!&quot;
<br />

<br />
SiMan laughed, &quot;Please Hedgehog, the M-team fears nothing!&quot;
<br />
&quot;It's going to contact more of them!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh, shut up!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Trust me, it will!&quot;
<br />
With that the human got some sticky tape out of his backpack and gagged him.
<br />

<br />
The walked for about half an hour more, until finally the jump-zone was in
<br />
sight.
<br />

<br />
It was then that Kalvin saw the army of robots assembled to attack him!
<br />
He drew his pistol, searching for a target. He found one, a humanoid.
<br />
Packbell laughed, &quot;Please, put that down..&quot; The swat-bots armed their=
<br />
&nbsp;weapons,
<br />
and the android spoke again, this time slowly putting emphasis on every
<br />
syllable. &quot;There.. is .. no .. way .. you .. can .. escape.. &quot;
<br />

<br />
The game-master smiled, &quot;Sorry!&quot;
<br />
He pulled the trigger, a corny 2-operator-FM-sound emmanated from the=
<br />
&nbsp;pistol,
<br />
and.. that was all.  He made a softish laughing sound, as the teams of=
<br />
&nbsp;Robots
<br />
jumped down amongst his team and captives, tying one captive to one=
<br />
&nbsp;M-member.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Back at Robotropolis, they sat waiting their fate. They were in a large=
<br />
&nbsp;metal
<br />
room with a stage about 2 meters high. Robotnik stood gloating on it, making
<br />
comments on how they were going to be robotocized. After ten minutes, he
<br />
left them alone as he went to prepare the robotocizer for their arrival.
<br />

<br />
Sonic moved his splines a bit, trying to make it as uncomfortable as=
<br />
&nbsp;possible
<br />
for Kalvin who was tied to his back. The human, in turn responded with an
<br />
insulting comment.
<br />
The human princess began next, &quot;VegaMan, help! I don't want to..&quot;
<br />
He croaked, &quot;Sorry your highness, I can't get free...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well, it's not like you've got anything to lose.. you're a robot!&quot;
<br />
They began arguing, David moaned... this was not the way he wanted to end
<br />
his organic functioning.
<br />
&quot;STOP IT!&quot; he commanded, &quot;We're all in trouble, we're all going to get
<br />
robotocized, and all you can do is fight!&quot;
<br />
The quieted.
<br />
He continued, &quot;For goodness sake, we're all similar. Look, we got two hero's
<br />
tied back to back, each one taking on a mega-techno-enemy. Two-princess's,
<br />
who have had their fathers sent into a void where mirrors and crystals seem
<br />
to have odd properties. Two mega techno-strong dudes, two fly guys.. hey..
<br />
and we've got two mindless morons who mumble on.&quot;
<br />
He felt slightly honoured that he was being compared to the blithering idiot
<br />
he was tied to--SiMan Belgoon.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Now, are we going to work together?&quot;
<br />
It was a stupid question, of course they were.. whether they liked one
<br />
another or not--they liked the idea of being a slave less than bad company.
<br />

<br />
After a good deal of struggling, which involved them making a human.. well..
<br />
person pyramid, to position Tails so he could rampage through
<br />
SiMan's backpack--looking for a knife or something sharp to cut them free,
<br />
they were quite humoured.
<br />
1 live chicken, a watermellon, inflatable bike, coin press, acme anvil,
<br />
and finally an electric bread cutter.
<br />

<br />
The group that was all supporting StickyGUS and Tails sighed in relief, as
<br />
they cut the rope around SiMan and David. SiMan fell back, David too,
<br />
something flew out of Belgoon's backpack... a shiny toroid..
<br />

<br />
&quot;MmmPPWWER MRRINGG!&quot; Sonic tried to spit out through the gag he still had=
<br />
&nbsp;on,
<br />
Sally after getting free removed it. A few minutes later they were all free.
<br />
Sonic picked up the Power-Ring, &quot;Hey Si? Wheredya get this?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh that, I found it in this pond..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Way cool, let's cruise.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; butt in the human princess,
<br />
&quot;we need the matter-translater--it's the only way we can get home again.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Robotnik!&quot; commented Sally.
<br />
The hedgehog looked worriedly, &quot;Okay.. I'll get it!&quot;
<br />
Captain-M looked oddly, &quot;Hey, we still have to get out of here!&quot;
<br />

<br />
David gave his strategic mind to them, &quot;What if we break into two teams,
<br />
collect a laser for you..&quot; he motioned Kalvin, &quot;get some percolated for=
<br />
&nbsp;me..&quot;
<br />
&quot;And..&quot; he motioned Sonic, &quot;get the translator..&quot;
<br />

<br />
They all agreed that the teams would be mixtures of M and Freedom Fighters,
<br />
that way neither side would have to worry about any (Brutus) backstabbing.
<br />

<br />
The teams were as follows:
<br />

<br />
A-Team: Sonic ,  Princess of Prowler , Tails    , Vegaman, David.
<br />
B-Team: Kalvin,  Princess Sally      , StickiGUS, Rotor  , SiMan.
<br />

<br />
It was decided that the A-team would collect the matter translator and
<br />
the high octane fuel, while the B-team would get a laser-rifle or two, and
<br />
clear a way out of the base--while providing a distraction for the A-team.
<br />
There were two doors in the room, each team took a door, not knowing whether
<br />
they would see their friends in the other team again.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
A lone swat-bot was most abruptly suprised as a whip wrapped itself around=
<br />
&nbsp;it,
<br />
however, though it was &quot;shocked&quot;, the whip did little more than leave an
<br />
unpleasant smell on it's 15Cm of titanium armour.
<br />
&quot;Ohh dear&quot;, remarked SiMan as it trampled towards him. Kalvin looked at the
<br />
metallic beast, hah, too easy, too easy, he was a gamemaster. He smiled,
<br />
placing one finger on the gamepad on his belt. &quot;Hey.. ugly over here!&quot;
<br />
The robot turned to face him as he jammed the button, once again another
<br />
cruddy FM sound was heard and no physical effect or magical graphics were
<br />
seen.
<br />

<br />
Kalvin backed up towards a wall, bumping his spine into a pipe. The robot
<br />
came closer, and closer, giving him a real idea of what it felt like to be
<br />
freedom fighter--shit scary. Suddenly the robot stopped, the whip still
<br />
attached around it's waste, and it's 'arms' still pinned to it's side, it
<br />
dropped like a christmas beetle to the ground. Sally smiled, holding the
<br />
smoking rifle... the same rifle it dropped when it had been hit by the whip.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** ** ** ** **
<br />
A thousand billion light years away under the solar warmth that sometimes
<br />
dared to penetrate the clouds that hung over the little piece of land
<br />
jutting out of the blue water, past the trees and the wrecked buildings,
<br />
over forests, and over destroyed dreams. Thaddeus Body screamed, of all=
<br />
&nbsp;things
<br />
that patch of Ablaters.. that Sonic patch.. that .. that.. oh.. Sonic and
<br />
Tails had beaten him again, making his Doom nightmares even worse, hey he
<br />
used to feel tough, strong and macho when he had a shotgun. But thanks to
<br />
the power of DEHACKED, the hedgehog could run a circle around him in the
<br />
time he took between shots. &quot;I hate that hedgehog&quot; he muttered, his brother
<br />
laughing in the background &quot;Crappy Sonic.. Crappy Sonic.&quot;
<br />

<br />
It was about then that he decided he needed a drink of nice cool refreshing
<br />
orange juice, though, seeing it was winter.. imitation Noros would have to
<br />
do instead. He stood up, and noticed the strain on his legs once more, damn,
<br />
doom always did that to him, ammong other things he was shivering. The
<br />
standard effects of forgetting to eat while playing computer games. He
<br />
walked through into the kitchen to see someone had left the cold water
<br />
bottle out of the fridge. Damn, it was standard practice for his younger
<br />
brother to abandon the thing when it was out of water. &quot;DAMNIT.. IF SOME
<br />
PEOPLE WOULD REFILL THE WATER AROUND HERE!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He opened the fridge, at least the 30 milli-litres of Noros would be cold,=
<br />
&nbsp;he
<br />
poured the horrid fluid into a cup, poured some warm water from the tap
<br />
into his cup and reeled at it. &quot;Oh.. need icecubes.&quot;
<br />
He opened the freezer to see an odd looking icecube, unlike the others
<br />
it was glowing green.. strange he thought to himself as he picked it up,
<br />
maybe his brother had been freezing Jello again. Geesh, of all things, he
<br />
hated it when the little runt started shoving stuff in the freezer, it
<br />
seemed to be a metal disorder induced by watching too much &quot;Toiwminator II.&quot;
<br />

<br />
However when he pulled the green cube out, he began to consider the fatal
<br />
possibility that it wasn't a standard drink coolant, nor a frozen dessert
<br />
ingredient. The stone glowed wierdly, emmanating a sort of light. He looked
<br />
around, nobody was watching him, so he slipped it into his pocket and
<br />
retreated to the safety of his &quot;den.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Inside he placed it on the table and examined it, it was perfectly square,
<br />
on the left side there were three buttons, marked: &quot;BITEND,BYTEEND,HIGH.&quot;
<br />
Making no logic of it he began to ponder how it would do at cooling his
<br />
drink, suddenly a fizzle of light appeared above it. Sparking in golden
<br />
aura's of mystery. Out of it formed an image.. it was a human, wearing a
<br />
SEGA shirt.
<br />

<br />
The hologram spoke, &quot;Thad, I don't have much time to explain,  I think=
<br />
&nbsp;they're
<br />
billing my account, and Mobius is DAMNED far. But well.. because the
<br />
communications service is so good here, you are getting this message before
<br />
I actually send it. Now listen well, press all three of the buttons on
<br />
this thing, it will teleport you to Mobius. When you arrive, remember,
<br />
you have to stop Sonic from using his power ring.. otherwise we are all
<br />
going to be soup.&quot;
<br />
The image began to fade away, leaving Thad very, very, very.. confused.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** **
<br />
Something ran over the cruddy monitors display before the human could figure
<br />
out exactly what it was. He managed to look up in time to see a graph
<br />
whizz by, whatever it was.. it meant danger.
<br />

<br />
Bill knew that this would oneday come, and now he had no choice, he
<br />
would have to go out in combat.. like a programmer. He was born a programmer
<br />
and he would die one. And the will that inspired him was simple--an insult,
<br />
someone had dared to crash Windoze 95 (Mobian Release)!
<br />
Something he couldn't tolerate... no it was simply unacceptable.. and=
<br />
&nbsp;whoever
<br />
was to blame would pay dearly.
<br />
Uncle Gates, slapped his MacroSlop jacket on, donned his GLOCK and pumper,
<br />
copied tetris-pro onto a CD and headed for the port'al room.
<br />

<br />
He passed armed imperial macroslop guards as he went, they saluted him--he
<br />
was more of a coder then they. At the centre of the wall stood the glowing
<br />
cyan spawner. It was shaped like a window, with four coloured squares=
<br />
&nbsp;instead
<br />
of glass, each of these squares took the user to another direction. And if,
<br />
the user became stuck at any time, he could simply pull down the easy to
<br />
read online help.
<br />
Someone stood behind the teleport control machine, saluting he threw the
<br />
switch, turning the coloured port'als into windows, each one seeing out into
<br />
another kingdom. He pranced through the hole and appeared in Mobius.
<br />

<br />
As he touched the floor he though to himself how odd it was, last time he=
<br />
&nbsp;had
<br />
been here, that was when that Acorn chap ruled, things were so much=
<br />
&nbsp;different.
<br />
The street where he stood was more grassy, less tarry, and the sky was a
<br />
good deal more blue. &quot;Well Acorn&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;it's an=
<br />
&nbsp;interesting
<br />
change.&quot; He still remembered the king, perhaps he would stop by and get some
<br />
coffie, after all they were good friends. Macroslop had coded Mobius's
<br />
most succesful auto city defence software.
<br />

<br />
&lt;SWAT-BOT DETECTED! GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT&gt;
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
Thad ran through Robotropolis, a series of SWAT-bots following him. In the
<br />
excitement he had forgot to bring any sort of weapon, though he did have
<br />
an umbrella.. but then again 10CM of stainless steel armour usually didn't
<br />
get pierced by atmosphere manipulator systems. A laser crashed down behind
<br />
him, causing him to feel a surge of power like no other, he was now
<br />
running at a rate he never would have believed possible. The thought crossed
<br />
his mind about SWAT-bot's as athletic coaches.. but he wasn't about to ask
<br />
one.
<br />

<br />
In the distance stood a man in a &quot;I love Windoze&quot; jacket, he seemed to
<br />
be oblivious to the oncoming danger. Thad screamed with all his might,
<br />
&quot;HEY GPF, LOOK OUT!&quot;
<br />
Bill rotated his body, shotgun drawn. Shortly Thad after noticing it was
<br />
pointing at him, stopped, the robots gaining in the distance.
<br />
&quot;Hey.. I'm on your side.. just lookout for those.. SWAT-BOTS!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
A lone robot stood in front of them, Thad cowered behind the shotgun holder.
<br />
The machine spoke, &quot;HALT FREEDOM FIGHTER YOU ARE UNDER ARREST!&quot;
<br />
Bill twisted his face to the side, &quot;Help.&quot;
<br />
The machine stood there, almost curious to his command.
<br />
The human's eyes suddenly glowed red with anger,
<br />
&quot;WHAT! NO ONLINE HELP! DAMN YOU.. YOU DAMNED OasiS/2 USER! DIE DIE!&quot;
<br />
He reeled shot after shot at the machine.
<br />

<br />
** A bruising half an hour later **
<br />

<br />
Stainless steel armour was stronger than lead, the two realised as Robotnik
<br />
grinned at them through the glass. They were in separate robotocizers, the
<br />
cylinders already lowered. Julian laughed, evily, &quot;Tell me.. Mr Gates.. you
<br />
know I always have wanted to ask this question.. what happens if you defrag
<br />
while you are in Windoze 3.1111?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh.. only a moron would do something like..&quot;
<br />
The man in red's facial expression showed who the Moron had been.
<br />
Bill quivered, &quot;of course, I mean.. that is a little bug.. really isn't it?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes.. indeed it is.. indeed it is.. now tell me dear young Todd.. or
<br />
whatever your name was.. have you ever played Doom?&quot;
<br />
He tried to suck up, &quot;Yeah.. and I got this way cool Sonic patch, from
<br />
Simon Howes in South Africa.. IT'S ALL HIS FAULT! And..well you shoot Sonic
<br />
and Tails.. like a lot..&quot;
<br />
&quot;Simon can wait till later, besides I can't teleport him here as his
<br />
AND-DX40 interferes with the teleporter. Now.. about this doom, were you
<br />
ever amazed by the texture mapping? Did you enjoy the thrill of shooting,
<br />
killing, and racing around virtual complexes? Did you ever think it was the
<br />
best program you ever saw?&quot;
<br />
&quot;YES! YES! YES!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bill in the other chamber lifted his glasses slightly, &quot;honestly, such
<br />
incompatible DOS4Gee_W programs, I just don't see how you can enjoy them..&quot;
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; unisoned the two.
<br />
&quot;Now&quot; put in Robotnik, &quot;won't you be happy to see IP's Quack?&quot;
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Good, well.. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO!&quot; he burst into uncontrolled laughter,
<br />
nearly falling over at times. &quot;GOODBYE!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He clicked the button in and walked out of the room, the SWAT-Bots could
<br />
take care of the rest. Besides, he had better things to do.. like play
<br />
Epit's ZZZT.
<br />

<br />
As the robotocizer began powering up, Thad looked over to Bill.
<br />
&quot;You damned moron, this is all your fault! WINDOZE CO-ORD!&quot;
<br />
A yellow beam came down over him, then Bill, he knew he was doomed, as was
<br />
Sonic, for nothing could stop him using the Power-Ring now.
<br />

<br />
Something happened, as the robotocizer scanned Gates, it detected the silver
<br />
CD in his pocket, it frantically read it, and uploaded it to the system for
<br />
study. The machine stopped, still in scan phase, and the glass shrouds
<br />
lifted, letting the still organic beings out. Thad saw the message
<br />
&quot;Unable to find vbrun300.dll&quot; on the one display.
<br />
Bill mumbled a comment about sloppy harddrive management.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />
As Sonic dived at a SWAT-bot in his full rotational fury, it suddenly=
<br />
&nbsp;dropped
<br />
out it's way. He ended up half a second later on the floor, spitting out
<br />
pieces of cement. As for the SWAT-bot.. it was strangely offline. The team
<br />
walked on, finding every single robot in the entire structure .. powerless.
<br />
It was easy to get the matter-translater, Robotnik was far to busy slamming
<br />
the keyboard in anger to notice the hedgehog creep in.
<br />

<br />
David got his cup of coffie with great ease too, though now there was=
<br />
&nbsp;nothing
<br />
to try it out on. The team met safely at the main gate. Sonic embraced=
<br />
&nbsp;Sally,
<br />
but suddenly stopped. &quot;Sal.. do *you* hear that?&quot;
<br />
She pricked her ears up, in the far off distance she could hear something,
<br />
a type of crackling.. no a type of.. CHEERING! Robotocized citizens=
<br />
&nbsp;everywhere
<br />
had broken their bonds, and were trashing the factories in which they=
<br />
&nbsp;worked.
<br />
&quot;Hey, Sal.. wait here.. I'm gonna check it out.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Thaddeus dived into vision, pulling the power-ring out of Sonic's hand=
<br />
&nbsp;before
<br />
he could use it. The resulting forces however threw the human face down onto
<br />
the floor. Sonic walked over to the stunned figure, &quot;hey buddy, what's the
<br />
problem?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No.. no.. power-ring.. no power-ring.. don't use it.. was warned by time
<br />
transport.. don't use this ring..&quot;
<br />
His tired body lapsed into sleep.
<br />

<br />
** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** **
<br />

<br />
He awoke three weeks later, though when he looked up, he saw the strangest
<br />
thing. Above him was a wooden ceiling, a beautiful wooden ceiling. Around=
<br />
&nbsp;him
<br />
stood Sonic and Sally, as well as someone wearing a crown. He smiled at the
<br />
human, &quot;Thankyou boy.. for your courage has saved us all.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Whe.. where am I? Who.. who.. are you?&quot;
<br />
&quot;You.. are in the second royal palace, and I am the King, King Acorn.&quot;
<br />
His eyes grew large in amazement, &quot;I though the palace was destroyed..&quot;
<br />
&quot;It was.. but you don't get to my age by being stupid, I always considered
<br />
I might need a second concealed castle, just in case the wife started began
<br />
on of those.. most embarassing divorce suits..&quot;
<br />
Thad stood up to stare out the window, outside the free mobians, who by
<br />
the looks of it were derobotocized, were beginning the hard task of
<br />
rebuilding their garden city. They were succeeding too. &quot;How?&quot;
<br />
David stepped over to him, laughing, &quot;when windoze hangs, it takes the
<br />
whole network with it. Robotnik even had his power stations running of
<br />
the Gateway, when that crashed, he couldn't even reboot.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Where is Bill now?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oh.. well after he.. err.. expressed his irritation, with a GLOCK to
<br />
Robotnik,  he went back to Earth. It seems that he was rather ticked that
<br />
Ivo errored out Windoze 95.&quot;
<br />
&quot;How?&quot;
<br />
&quot;He shelled to MS-DOG to run ZZZT.&quot;
<br />
&quot;So.. &quot; he smiled, &quot;it was his own passion for adventure that destroyed=
<br />
&nbsp;him.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The king smiled, &quot;Indeed it was, and it has cost him dearly.. but that no
<br />
longer matters friends, for now is a time for a grand feast.&quot;
<br />

<br />
###
<br />

<br />
And so our story ended, with the M-team pushing off with their matter
<br />
translator, David decided to stay on Mobius, rather than risk having to get
<br />
a.. [fox/dog?] license for himself from the SPCA. Thaddeus however, decided
<br />
that though the world he was born on sucked, it was his destiny. And now the
<br />
forces of evil had been banished here.. he could return home and sleep
<br />
peacefully, knowing the onslaught was over, and that never again, forces
<br />
of such evil would tear a planet.
<br />

<br />
Of course, Bill was hailed a Mobian hero, they named a day after him, a day
<br />
where everybody painted their windows in different colours. It was called
<br />
the day of the write-back-cache.
<br />

<br />
Back on Earth the human genius rolled in his earnings from the Macroslop
<br />
products, but something he detected was wrong.. every day, there were more
<br />
OasiS/2 users. Every day.. someone would write him into a satire. The humans
<br />
couldn't accept their fate, he looked over a machine he had acquired, that
<br />
now rested in his television room. He stroked the glass cylinder smoothly,
<br />
and spoke softly to himself, &quot;The users, will just have to be made more
<br />
efficient.. won't they Bill.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is what he did.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, here are the crappy morals:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-------------------------------------
<br />
&nbsp; Even though the two teams were different species, they managed to work
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together. Why then should we be racist?
<br />
&nbsp; Love Conquers All, King Grayhum.
<br />
&nbsp; Never, never, never.. try taking on a SWAT-Bot in unnarmed combat.
<br />
&nbsp; Don't bother posting David any web-stories, he doesn't live on Earth
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anymore, and Mobius has CompuSurf. (Well, that the impression *I* got)
<br />
&nbsp; Do not expose percolated_coffie to a naked flame!
<br />
&nbsp; Do not freeze Jello.
<br />
&nbsp; Chill, loosen up, grow some fur and a cute tail, then move the hell of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this sphere of shit we're on.

Q. Why mustn't Sonic use the power ring?
<br />
A. Urrm, well actually.. urrm.. ohya.. SiMan got jam on it while it was in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his backpack, this would have affected the DNA recognition of the ring,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blowing the little dude into a coupl'a'billion_pieces.
<br />

<br />
Q. If he nuked, how did David send a message from the future?
<br />
A. Urrmm.. well.. oh yah.. David was still on a coffie high, and was able
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to outrun the photons, to read the Eudoma manual and mail Thad.
<br />

<br />
Q. How did the green-icecube end up in Thad's freezer?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STUPID STORIES!
<br />

<br />

<br />
A1.You again, I though I had you taken care off..
<br />
A2.Phone that nice lady (Anne) and tell her about your deep intentions,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she will give you a santa-like costume to wear. Put it on, grow and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orange mustache, and pay Me, Thad, Linds_E, Dan, Shawn, or Brad a visit.
<br />
A3.While running Windoze, start recording a wave file, shell to an old HD
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defragger, and defrag your Harddrive.. if you can recover it from that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you can do *ANYTHING*
