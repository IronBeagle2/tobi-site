<p><b>Compatibility Information</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<!-- 48110 -->
<p>If you have the Crescendo 5.01 plug-in, you must update to the latest version of Crescendo. Otherwise, Netscape 6 may crash at startup.

<p>If you are using an ATI Rage video card, images are correctly displayed initially, but may not be properly re-drawn when you minimize and maximize or resize the window.</p>

<!-- 42997 -->
<p>Problem have been reported running Outlook 2000 (not Outlook Express) with Netscape 6. If you experience problems, be sure you have any recent updates to Outlook 2000. If problems persist, quit Outlook 2000 before starting Netscape 6.</p>

<!-- 51920 -->
<p>If you use True Type fonts with Netscape 6, some characters are displayed as squares.</p>

<p><b>Mac OS</b></p>

<p>QuickTime is required before installing Netscape 6. <!-- 59059 --> If QuickTime is disabled, Netscape 6 will not start.</p>

<!-- 58104 -->
<p>There is a known conflict with Adobe Type Manager, which causes windows to appear blank. Workaround: Uninstall ATM before you start Netscape 6.</p>

<!-- 2569 -->
<p>If you have version 5.5 (or earlier) of Stuffit Expander may see an error message stating that the archive is corrupted. You can ignore the message and continue with the installation. To get a newer version of Stuffit Expander, go to <a href="http://www.aladdinsys..com/expander/expander_mac_login.html">
http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html</a></p>

<p>If you attempt to run Netscape 6 on Mac OS using a language pack (such as the Japanese Language Pack) and a Language Kit, all menu bar items will be incorrectly displayed. To resolve this problem, register Netscape 6 using the Language Register. For instance, if you're using the Japanese Language Pack and the Japanese Language Kit, register Netscape 6 as a JA application.</p>

<p>If you use the SmoothType control panel instead of Apple's "Smooth all fonts on screen" option in the Appearance control panel, you need SmoothType version 2.1.1 for Netscape 6. Netscape 6 is not compatible with earlier versions of SmoothType, and some pages may be improperly drawn. To get an update, go to 
<a href="http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/smoothtype.html">
http://www.kaleidoscope.net/greg/smoothtype.html.</a></p>

<!-- 54365 -->
<p>In Netscape Mail, the import utility supports only Eudora and text files.</p>

<p><b>Linux</b></p>

<!-- 44787 -->
<p>Netscape 6 requires glibc 2.1 or later.

<!-- 58259 -->
<p>If you have Red Hat Linux 6.0, you can't launch Netscape 6 if Java 2 is installed. The problem doesn't occur with Red Hat 6.1.

<p>To run Netscape 6 on SuSe Linux 6.2, you must install the file libjpeg.so.62 available <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>

<!-- 45747 -->
<p>Netscape 6 does not work with Microsoft Proxy server version 2.0.

<a NAME="install"></a>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=+1 color="darkblue">
<p><b>Installation Notes</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<!-- 64929 -->
<p>Installing Netscape 6.01 in the same directory as Mozilla results in a crash. Workaround: Uninstall any Mozilla builds before installing 6.01 or install 6.01 to a different directory than a Mozilla build.

<p>When you install Netscape 6 in a directory or folder that already contains an earlier version of Netscape 6 (Preview Release 1, 2, or 3), a dialog box appears recommending that you delete the older version of Netscape 6. Your profile information is unaffected and will not be deleted if you choose Delete. For almost all users, choosing Delete is a safe and preferred option. You only need to be concerned about losing profile information if you moved your Preview Release profile to a subdirectory of the Netscape 6 folder (profile information is stored elsewhere by default).</p>

<!-- 42184, 41057 -->
<p>If you are installing Netscape 6 on a multi-user operating system such as Linux, Unix, or Windows 2000, you should install it separately in the user directory of each user who plans to use Netscape 6. If you install Netscape 6 in a shared write-protected directory, it may not run properly.

<!-- 46318 -->
<p>When you install language packs (.xpi files), downloading pauses until you click the browser's Stop button.</p>

<!-- 54637 -->
<p>(Windows) If you have previously installed Netscape 6 and/or Netscape Personal Security Manager, search your drives for psm.exe, and delete the folder that it resides in and all its subfolders before installing Netscape 6.

<!-- 45067 -->
<p>(Windows) Installing Java with low disk space may cause the Installer to hang. Before you begin installing Netscape 6 with Java, be sure to check your disk space (see <a href="#require">System Requirements</a>.)</p>

<!-- 53670 -->
<p>If you are updating from the PR3 version of Netscape 6, and you used a third-party theme in PR3, Netscape 6 will crash.

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">
<!-- 46558 -->
<p>Before installing on Linux, you must have write permission for the 
target installation directory.</p>

<!-- 59012 -->
<p>For RedHat version 7, you must install the Standard C++ libraries for Red Hat 6.2 backwards compatibility. You can find the package on the RedHat 7 installation CD <a href="http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/compat-libstdc++-6.2-2.9.0.9.i386.html">
here.</a>

<ol>
<li>Download the netscape-i686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz archive.
<li>Type the following to gunzip and untar the archive:<br> 
<tt>tar -zxvf netscape-i686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz</tt>
<li>Run the Netscape 6 Installer with the run script:<br>
<tt>./netscape-installer</tt>
<li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete installation.
<li>To start Netscape, change to the directory where you installed it and run the program: ./netscape 
</ol>

<!-- 49345 -->
<p>You must run Netscape 6 at least once to complete autoregistration and for the component.reg file to be written to the installation directory. If a different user (other than the person who installed the product) runs the program first, a core dump will occur.

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<!-- 6061 -->
<p>If you change the bit depth (number of colors) in your monitor settings, Netscape 6 may not adjust to the new setting.

<!-- 50424 -->
<p>(Windows) Launching Netscape 6 a second time, while Netscape 6 is already running, does not cause a new Netscape 6 window to open. Workaround: click on an open Netscape window and press Ctrl-1. If Netscape is still running but has no windows open, press ctrl-alt-del first.

<!-- 55686 -->
<p>Alt-click (Option-click on Mac OS) on a link does not cause the linked file to be saved. Some web sites may prompt you to do this, but it won't work with Netscape 6. Instead, go to the linked page and save it directly.

</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=-1>
<p><b>Keyboard and Mouse</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>Keyboard shortcuts are not fully implemented. Some shortcuts for editing (for instance, for cutting or copying text) do not work in certain dialog boxes. Several keyboard shortcuts for menu items do not work.</p>

<!-- 49909 -->
<p>(Linux) Keyboard shortcuts on Linux now use Control instead of Alt as the modifier key, while Alt is used for menu shortcuts. If you wish to modify these shortcut keys, edit your prefs.js file as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>user_pref("ui.key.accelKey", 18);</tt><br>
This changes the accelerator key from Control (17) to Alto (18)<br><br>
<tt>user_pref("ui.key.menuAccessKey", 0);</tt><br>
This changes the menu access key from Alt (18) to none
</blockquote>

<p><b>Mousewheel scrolling</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<!-- Information from Brian Ryner -->

<p>Unix: You must have your X server properly configured. For XFree86, add a line to the Pointer section of your XF86Config files such as "ZAxisMapping 4 5". Also be sure that the Protocol line is set up correctly for your mouse.</p>

<p>Windows: Mousewheel scrolling does not work with all drivers. If you have problems, try updating your driver or disabling any "helper" programs that your mouse uses. Also, mousewheel scrolling will not work if you have the scrolling set to "full-page mode" in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Mac OS: Mousewheel scrolling (for USB mice) is not yet implemented for Mac OS. (Fixed in version 6.01.)</p>

</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=-1>
<p><b>Dialog Boxes and Windows</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<!-- 55261 -->
<p>If Netscape 6 is locked up but doesn't seem to have crashed, make sure there are no dialog boxes still open. Close each window on your desktop one at a time and if you uncover a dialog window, dismiss it. If you have multiple desktops repeat these steps for each desktop.

<p>This problem may affect Linux users downloading plugins. Follow these steps to resolve the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Minimize the plugin download window.
<li>Click "Cancel" to dismiss the dialog box.
<li>Re-open the download window and continue downloading the plugin.

<!-- 46415 -->
<p>Many Linux systems (in particular, Redhat systems) have bad Arial fonts. If many web pages, especially those using the Arial font, look unclear, small, or  hard to read, the following links explain two ways you can change your font server to get better Arial fonts:

http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#ttf 
http://home.c2i.net/dark/linux.html#fuzzy  

<p>If that doesn't work, you may be able to fix the problem by renaming or removing /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2. For instance, do this:

<tt>mv /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2</tt>

<p>and then log out of Linux and log back in again. You can always undo this, if necessary, with the command:

<tt>mv /usr/share/fonts.ISO8859-2 /usr/share/fonts/ISO8859-2</tt>

<a NAME="profiles"></a>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica" size=+1>
<p><b>Setting Profiles</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>If you have a single profile from Communicator version 4.5 or later, that profile is automatically copied and converted for use with Netscape 6. Profiles from earlier Netscape versions cannot be converted.</p>

<p>If you have multiple profiles to copy and convert, the profile manager dialog box appears. Click the profile you want to use, then click Start.</p>

<p>If problems occur during installation and your Communicator profile was not copied and converted, you can still use your profile. Launch Netscape 6 from the command line, appending the "-installer" option (that is, type "netscp6.exe-installer" on the command line.) Or re-install Netscape 6 to see the profile manager dialog again.</p>

<!-- 58371 -->
<p>(Linux) If you are unable to migrate a Communicator profile, check the /tmp directory and remove any prefs.js file that you find.

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>For additional technical information, please visit <a href="http://home.netscape.com/eng/intl">Technical
Information page</a> for International Users.

<p>Netscape 6 has been designed to display many different languages without
extra steps. The user should be able to browse and use e-mail without complicated
setups or efforts when necessary fonts are available on the system.

<p>Netscape 6 can be used with more than 1 language packs, which lets the
user change the menu language and relevant URLs.

<p>Java (JRE 1.3) is installed under the "Complete" or "Custom"
Install option of&nbsp; the installer. All language versions of Netscape
6 installs an international version of JRE 1.3.0_01 for Windows and Unix,
which makes it possible to display both European and Asian characters.
Earlier versions of JRE which shipped with Beta versions of Netscape 6
may not work properly with the shipping version of Netscape 6. For those
wanting Java functionality, we recommend "Complete" or "Custom"&nbsp;
Install option.

<p>If you are using Chinese, Korean or Japanese language Windows 95/98
and are having a non-start or crash problem when trying to start up Netscape

<p><b>General and Profile Manager</b></p>
</font>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>On Windows 2000 and Windows NT4: If you create a non-ASCII user name
(e.g. Japanese) and if it does not have the Power user or Administrator
status, a new profile creation may fail. In such a case, instead of accepting
the default location for profiles, choose an alternate location whose path
name does not contain non-ASCII characters.

<p>A path name which contains non-Latin 1 characters is not saved correctly.
Initially they look OK but when saved, they turn into unreadable characters.
A file that is defined using such characters may not be found, e.g. a mail
signature file. A workaround is to use only ASCII characters for file and
path names.

<p>Profile migration does not work correctly if Communicator 4.x profile
names contain 2-byte characters (e.g. Japanese) with 0x5C byte Shift_JIS
character.

<p>Shift_JIS Full-width tilde character (0x8160)&nbsp; and a few other
Japanese symbol characters have differing correspondences to Unicode mapping
tables depending on platforms. This causes characters like these to display
incorrectly in some situations on Macintosh.

<p>Unix: On Red Hat Linux 6.0 Japanese, the license agreement for the Japanese
installer may display empty. A workaround is to simply click OK and move
on to the next step. This problem does not occur on RH 6.1 and later.

<p>Unix: When migrating profiles created by Communicator 4.x under Japanese
EUC locale, Address Book entries may not transfer correctly. As a workaround,
you can edit preferences.js file and change the charset name "euc-jp" (lowercase)
to "EUC-JP" (uppercase) for lines containing an entry like the following:
"user_pref("ldap_2.servers.pab.csid", "euc-jp");"

<p>Unix: Under a Japanese locale on Unix, the window title in Japanese
(reflecting the title of a web page) may not show correctly if the web
page does not match the charset of the Japanese locale, e.g. Shift_JIS
title on an EUC locale.

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>Netscape 6 does not support Dynamic Fonts. (Note: It was supported in
Communicator 4.x.)

<p>Files and directories on a local disk bearing non-Latin 1 names may
not be accessed by inputting the names into the Navigator location field.

<p>JavaScript: The charset attribute within a SCRIPT tag, i.e. for JavaScript,
does not work. Instead JavaScript uses the charset of the document.

<p>Windows 2000 IME: Most of the new IME features (e.g. reconversion) are
supported but some features may not work correctly.

<p>Mac only: Non-ASCII non-Latin 1 info stored in Internet Config will
not show correctly in auto-fill fields such as "Your name" field in the
Mail account setup dialog. If this happens, you can manually correct auto-filled
entries.

<p>Mac only: The Japanese language pack or Japanese release can
be used on an English Mac OS if the Japanese Language Kit has been installed
on the Mac OS. (The Japanese Language support comes free with Mac OS 8.5
or later as an optional install item.) The menu and dialogs, however, will
not show as Japanese unless the "Netscape" program is registered as a Japanese
language program. To do this, use the (Japanese) Language register program
found in the "Apple Extras" directory.

<p>Mac only: The Character Coding menu check mark does not get updated
promptly and shows incorrect indication of the current page encoding.

<p><b>Mail</b></p>

<font face="Arial,Helvetica">

<p>POP and Local message body search does not work with non-Latin 1 key
words.

<p>Filtering by body key has not been implemented.

<p>"Edit as New"&nbsp; menu does not correctly quote the original non-ASCII
text body&nbsp; if the original message does not contain MIME charset information.

<p>When you quote the original message in reply, sometime you see the quoted
text corrupted and unreadable. If this problem occurs, try to see if you
don't have multiple Mail folder windows open. When multiple mail folders/windows
are open, the reply charset reflects the charset of the selected message
in the last window opened rather than the current message from which the
reply message is created. To workaround this bug, the user can either close
all Mail folder windows except the current one, or select a message in
the last window opened which bears the same charset as the one that is
being quoted in reply.

<p>Character Coding menu is not effective in a standalone message view
window. The standalone window also does not inherit the encoding of the
Mail view window if the original message contains no MIME charset or incorrect
charset information. The latter 2 can be overridden but its effect is not
inherited into the standalone window.

<p>Mac &amp; Unix only: View Page Source: does not work for viewing
a message source when the Auto-Detect (All) is ON. To use this function
in Mail, turn off the Auto-Detect (All) from "View | Character Coding"
menu.

<p>Japanese Auto-detection may fail sometimes with EUC-xx and UTF-8 attachments,
which lack MIME charset information.

<p>Character Coding menu cannot correct the thread pane display of non-MIME
encoded headers. If the message displayed lacks MIME charset information,
the thread pane display obeys the default message display charset set in
"Edit | Preferences | Mail &amp; Newsgroups | Message Display | Languages".
Correctly setting this option to charset most often used in the user's
mail viewing helps avoid display problem of this type.

<li>
The user may see an extraneous vertical bar or a question mark in the window
title display of a header subject line. This is a misinterpreted Tab character
sent from an IMAP server as part of a line folding sequence. This problem
does not occur under a POP mail account.</li>

<li>
You may get an error message saying that a mailbox does not exist when
you attempt to "Empty Trash". This problem is caused when the Trash folder
contains folders bearing non-ASCII names. You may not see them with Netscape
6 but you can delete them using Communicator 4.x. This will eliminate the
warning dialog.</li>

<!-- bugscape 3815 -->
<p>If you have installed a Netscape 6.0 language pack, and have migrated a profile from Netscape 6.0 to 6.01, the  Buddy List tab may not be visible. Workaround: Download the updated language pack(s) by selecting Download More from View | Set Language/Region menu, close the browser session, then relaunch Netscape 6.</p>

<p>Chat messages exchanged among Netscape 6 IM clients can support many
different languages. Generally speaking, message exchanges between Netscape
6 and standalone AIM clients are somewhat limited. Standalone AIM clients
are monolingual and so work best with Netscape IM of the same language.

<p>When Japanese chat messages are sent from non-Japanese Netscape 6 IM
and received by a Mac 2.0-Japanese, the message might reset the Mac font
and the input method keyboard. This makes AIM 2.0-J use a Western font
to display Japanese and make Japanese messages unreadable. We recommend
upgrading to AIM 4.x-Japanese.

<p>Non-ASCII session logs may not saved correctly in text format.

<p>Some cases have been reported in which Windows 95/98 Japanese users
have a problem starting Netscape 6 when there is a prior installation of
older JDK or JRE under the operating system in use. The JRE 130_01 which
ships with Netscape 6 contains many fixes since the official release of
JRE 1.3. If you are using an older version of JRE 1.3 or the US version
of JRE 1.3 under Japanese Windows, you may experience this non-start problem.
You can correct this problem using the following method.

<ul>

<li>
Determine if the non-starting problem is due to Java installation.
To do this,</li>

<ol>

<li>
Locate the Plugins directory which is found in the same directory as the
Netscape executable.</li>

<li>
Remove all the Java plugin files from the Plug in directory, i.e. the files
whose names begin with "npjava...". Remove also "NPOJI600.dll" if
you find one. Put them in some other directory so that you can put them
back later.</li>

<li>
Now re-start Netscape 6. If Netscape 6 starts, then you have a Java related
non-start problem.</li>

</ol>

</ul>

<ul>

<li>
If you have the Java problem as described above or want to install updated
JRE 130_01 shipped with Netscape 6, do the following:</li>

<ol>

<li>
First, open the Control Panel's Add/Delete utility.</li>

<li>
Locate the old JRE installation (Java Runtime Environment). Delete it.</li>

<li>
After the old JRE is deleted, run the Netscape 6 installer and choose either
"Complete" or "Custom" installation making sure that Java is installed
in the latter option. (Note that the "Typical" install does
not install the JRE package but if there is an existing JDK or JRE on the
operating system, the installer copies Java plugin files and place them
into Netscape 6's Plugins directory.) This will install the latest version of JRE 130_01, which works with Netscape 6.</li>

<p>
This type of problem has not been reported for Windows NT4 and 2000. But
if you experience this problem on the latter 2 platforms, follow the above
steps for them also.</p>
